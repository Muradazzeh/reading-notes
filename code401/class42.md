If you are thinking about the comparison of Vanilla js vs React then don’t worry here you will find the main points of the comparison. Vanilla js applications usually start with the initial UI that is created on the server like HTML. While ReactJs applications start with a blank HTML and later developers can dynamically create the initial state in JavaScript. If you want to store data in Vanilla js then it will be stored in DOM but in ReactJs applications, data will be directly stored in regular JavaScript variables.

If you are wondering, is React better than vanilla js then you have to understand what is vanilla js and what is react js. The developers can update the UI in Vanilla js with the help of DOM as they have to manually update or remove the elements. But ReactJs automatically updates the UI by using the setting of changing state within the component.
