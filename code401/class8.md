## Access Control (ACL)
### What is RBAC

* RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.
* Benefits of RBAC?
With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

### RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL
* Access control lists (ACL) — An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.
* Attribute-based access control (ABAC) — ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required

### RBAC implementation
*  Inventory your systems
* Analyze your workforce and create roles
* Assign people to roles
* Never make one-off changes
* Audit

* If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?

**Authorization is the process of giving someone the ability to access a resource**

###  primary rules defined for RBAC
